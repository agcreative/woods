					In 1867, when James W. Woods was four years old, the
					Dominion of Canada was born - three British Colonies
					confederated into one vast nation with enormous regions
					stil to be discovered and explored. Woods was surely
					inspired by the youthfulness and possibility of his times
					and his own early years were as rife with opportunity. In
					1885, he established himself as an outfitter of canvas supplies
					to lumbermen in the Ottawa Valley and his fortunes would
					continue to be closely linked with those of his country in
					the decades to follow.

			<p class="textblock rotate">Back home in Canada, the nation was expanding
			westward and Woods was leading the grand adventure. The Klondike Gold
			rush had begun in 1896 with the discovery of gold at Bonanza Creek in
			the Yukon. For the next several years, the area was flush with "stampeders"
			carrying Woods packsacks stocked with Woods tents, sleeping bags, mackinaw
			sweaters, camp stoves and more. In 1898, notable geologist and mining consultant
			Joseph B. Tyrell wrote to Woods to "testify to the excellence of the Eiderdown
			sleeping bag obtained from you," which he declared "the most comfortable bed
			that I have ever had in the field."

			<h2 class="rotate">A defining moment in Canadian history</h2>
			<p class="textblock1 rotate">With the news of Amundsen's Artic journey and those of others
			at the time, the Canadian government was awakening to vital issues of Artic sovereignty. Part
			of their <img src="images/chapter8/transparent.png" alt="transparent" style="float: right; height: 340px; width: 300px;" />response was to underline their claim on the region with Primie Minister Sir Robert
			Borden's sponsorship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition in 1913. As a multidisciplinary study
			of the Arctic and its people, the expedition was the first of its kind. Led by Vilhjalmur
			Steffanson, the Canadian-born son of Icelandic immigrants, the five year mission was
			not without its perils with 17 crew members lost. However, results of the CAE were enormously
			significant, including the discovery of three new Canadian Islands,</p>
			
			<p class="textblock2 rotate">correction of centuries-old mapping errors, the uncovering
			of mineral deposits and immense archeological, biological and geological surveys.
			The CAE's observations were captured on <img src="images/chapter8/transparent.png" alt="transparent" style="float: left; height: 280px; width: 186px;" />sounds recordings, nearly 4,000 photographs and
			9,000 feet of motion picture film.  Well documented in this collection are several
			images of Woods canvas products, including tents, sleeping bags and the down-filled
			Woods Artic Parka, which had been developed specially for the mission.</p>

			<p class="textblock1 rotate">
				The Canadian Artic Expedition

				from the knowledge of the First
				World War which had been embroiling
				much of the rest of <br />the world since
				1914. But the
			</p>
			<p class="textblock2 rotate">war was another important mission for Woods. During WWI,
			James W. Woods was the Lieutenant-General of the Governor
			General's Foot Guards regiment and tragically, his eldest son
			John R. Woods was killed while serving overseas. Supplying tents,
			sleeping bags and other goods to Allied soldiers in both World Wars,
			Woods also created the first gas masks for the Canadian army. Indeed the
			reach of Woods into Canadian life was so extensive that during WWII the company<br />
			published an advertisement requesting<br /> customers' patience while Woods'<br />
			production was tied up in<br /> supporting the war effort.</p>

			<h2 class="rotate">The legacy of exploration grows</h2>
			<p class="textblock1 rotate">Meanwhile, through Woods' affiliations with both the
			National Geographic Society and the Royal Geographic Society in the U.K., Woods Canada
			outfitted many more of the most important exploratory ventures of the early 20th Century,
			including the Roosevelt Field Expedition through<br /> Central Asia, Admiral Byrd's expedition
			in the Antartic<br /> and the first ascent of Canada's highest peak,<br /> Mount Logan. in 1925.	
			</p>
			<p class="textblock2 rotate">Woods played another vital role in Canadian history when
			it outfitted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police schooner, St Roch, in the late nineteen
			thirties. In 1940-1942, the St Roch became the first vessel to complete a voyage through<br />
			the Northwest Passage in <br />a west to east direction, <br />and in 1944 became the <br />first vessel to make
			a <br />return trip through the <br />Northwest Passage in a<br /> single season. In 1950</p>
			
			<p class="textblock3 rotate">she became the first vessel to circumnavigate North America.
			The St Roch is currently on display in the Canadian National Maritime Museum in Vancouver
			for preservation.</p>

			Woods advertised their gear as used by
			"porch sleepers, fishermen, campers,
			hunters, explorers, aviators, prospectors
			and sourdoughs." Their tents included
			those for ordinary campers, for children,
			for backyard garden parties, carnivals,
			and even black tents for moving picture
			shows. Woods manufactured bags for
			newsboys, mail carriers, and railway</p>
			
			<p class="textblock2 rotate">laundry. They made piano covers, horse blankets, canvas car garages, life
			preservers, golf bags and bags for hockey equipment. They were also proclaimed
			to be the largest flag manufacturers in Canada
