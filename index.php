				<p class="textblock rotate">
					In 1867, when James W. Woods was four years old, the
					Dominion of Canada was born - three British Colonies
					confederated into one vast nation with enormous regions
					stil to be discovered and explored. Woods was surely
					inspired by the youthfulness and possibility of his times
					and his own early years were as rife with opportunity. In
					1885, he established himself as an outfitter of canvas supplies
					to lumbermen in the Ottawa Valley and his fortunes would
					continue to be closely linked with those of his country in
					the decades to follow.

			General's Foot Guards regiment and tragically, his eldest son
			John R. Woods was killed while serving overseas. Supplying tents,
			sleeping bags and other goods to Allied soldiers in both World Wars,
			Woods also created the first gas masks for the Canadian army. Indeed the

			<p class="textblock1 rotate">Meanwhile, through Woods' affiliations with both the
			National Geographic Society and the Royal Geographic Society in the U.K., Woods Canada
			outfitted many more of the most important exploratory ventures of the early 20th Century,
			including the Roosevelt Field Expedition through<br /> Central Asia, Admiral Byrd's expedition
			in the Antartic<br /> and the first ascent of Canada's highest peak,<br /> Mount Logan. in 1925.	
			</p>
			<p class="textblock2 rotate">Woods played another vital role in Canadian history when
			it outfitted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police schooner, St Roch, in the late nineteen
			thirties. In 1940-1942, the St Roch became the first vessel to complete a voyage through<br />
			the Northwest Passage in <br />a west to east direction, <br />and in 1944 became the <br />first vessel to make
			a <br />return trip through the <br />Northwest Passage in a<br /> single season. In 1950</p>
			
			<p class="textblock3 rotate">she became the first vessel to circumnavigate North America.
			The St Roch is currently on display in the Canadian National Maritime Museum in Vancouver
			for preservation.</p>

			to Woods outdoor gear. The use of the automobile for recreational purpose grew

			Woods advertised their gear as used by
			"porch sleepers, fishermen, campers,
			hunters, explorers, aviators, prospectors
			and sourdoughs." Their tents included
			those for ordinary campers, for children,
			for backyard garden parties, carnivals,
			and even black tents for moving picture
			shows. Woods manufactured bags for
			newsboys, mail carriers, and railway</p>
			
			<p class="textblock2 rotate">laundry. They made piano covers, horse blankets, canvas car garages, life
			preservers, golf bags and bags for hockey equipment. They were also proclaimed

			Even Ernest Hemingway, the celebrated American author and avid outdoorsman, had Woods

			<p class="textblock1 rotate">
				By 1982, there were few places on earth where Woods and
